=================

- Automation of tasks is made possible by an interface between applications and the terminal.

- Each interface usually supports many options, making it highly configurable.

- Interfaces can be connected and crafted together do do what you want.

- Much like regular programming, but you take advantage of all the functions, programs, that are available.
