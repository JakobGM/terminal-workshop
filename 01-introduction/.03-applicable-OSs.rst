UNIX systems have what we call "terminal". 
What is UNIX? Long story short: macOS and Linux have some common code, or implementations. 

Terminal on Windows? Equivalent is "Command prompt" or "Power shell", but the are not very similar to the terminal. However: you can use Windows to connect to a Linux server, much like remote desktop. 

You can also install something called "Linux subsystem for Windows", but this is reserved for advanced users for this workshop.
