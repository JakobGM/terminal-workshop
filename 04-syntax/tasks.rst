A command for finding all files and directories has the following syntax:

        **find <directory_to_look> [flags] [pattern]**


A file with your favorite Orakeltjeneste helpdesk is hidden in the directory called **secrets**. 
These desks are: Dragvoll, Gløshaugen, Øya, Handelshøyskolen and Kalvskinnet. 

#. What is the **<directory_to_look>** in this case?
#. Find all files in the current (**.**) directory.
#. If you were to find your own file, what would [pattern] look like?
#. To make **find** match all files and dirs with [pattern], we must pass the following flag: **-name**
#. There is another file with your username, but the letters are a mix of lower and upper case! 
   Rerun the command, but with this option instead:
   **-iname**
