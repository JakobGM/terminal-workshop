# Task A
========

#. You want to know the word count of **"A Christmas Carol.txt"**. Try to google which command you can use and use it.
#. For the command you found above, use **man** to find out how to count the number of *characters* in **"A Christmas Carol.txt"**.
#. This time use **--help** with the same command in order to learn how to find the widest line (as a number of characters) in the book.
#. Finally, use **tldr** with **ls** in order to find out how to display the number of *kilobytes*, not *bytes*, the book consists of.
